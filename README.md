# Django-poll-app

Django poll app created for practice. Instructions taken from Django site

## Why am I doing such an easy project

Yes, this project is piss easy but, after writing exams and taking a 2 month break from Django after just having learnt it, I realised I'd basically forgotten all the important stuff.

Clearly, I needed to make notes. This manifested itself into learning Rmarkdown and bookdown. I'm basically making Django notes to simultaneously practice creating outstanding notes which output in HTML and $\LaTeX$.

I really enjoy typesetting stuff so hey why not
